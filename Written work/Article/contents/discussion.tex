data targets have not been cross checked by the skill professionals..


how to encounter imblanced data classe:

-  random down sample in each epoch.. It can remove useful imformation
- use weigthingPenalized Models the the loss function
- learn the distribution of the miniorty classes and up sample those
his change is called sampling your dataset and there are two main methods that you can use to even-up the classes:



under sampling .. smide information væk... måske kan det give en bedre predectering???




You can add copies of instances from the under-represented class called over-sampling (or more formally sampling with replacement), or
You can delete instances from the over-represented class, called under-sampling.



i did not subtract the mean picture in traning... not normalize -> failure


batch normalization,


bat size... low -> fewer discarding images in the final batch



The CNN reducing spectral variance, this can be an issue for the LSTM...
