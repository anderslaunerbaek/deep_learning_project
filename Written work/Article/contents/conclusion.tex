\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This project has successfully reproduced the VGGNet in \cite{main_ar} in TF which was one of the objectives. The network has successfully fine-tuned the dropout operations and the weights in its final fully connected layer. 
The VGGNet network have been used as the baseline. The chosen implementation of the RNN does note outperform the baseline in average performance metrics (see table \ref{tab_res_2}), despite the RNN does achieve better classification sensitivity in the sleep stage W and in the sleep stage R (see table \ref{tab_res_1}). 

Further improvements in this projects can be achieved by merging sleep stage N3 and sleep stage N4 together. Study the affect of stacking multiple LSTM cells and apply the LSTM cell from layers with a lower-level feature representation and a higher spatial variance.
