\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This project has successfully re-produced \cite{main_ar} in TF which was one objectives, despite introducing few different approaches. 
This projects has successfully implemented the VGGNet 16, fine-tuned the dropout operations and the weights in its final fully connected layer. The network have been used as the baseline. The chosen implementation of the RNN does note out-perform the baseline network on average (table \ref{tab_res_2}), despite the RNN does archive better classification sensitivity in the following sleeping stages W and R (table \ref{tab_res_1}). 

Further improvements in this projects can be archived by study the effect of stacking multiple LSTM cells and applied the LSTM cells from layers with a lower feature representation higher and spectral variance.
