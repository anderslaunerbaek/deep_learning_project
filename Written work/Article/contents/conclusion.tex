\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

%This project has successfully reproduced the VGGNet in \cite{main_ar} in TF which was one of the objectives. 
%The network has successfully fine-tuned the dropout operations and the weights in its final fully connected layer. 

The VGGNet have been implemented and used as the baseline. The chosen implementation of the RNN does not outperform the baseline in the average performance metrics, however the RNN does achieve better classification sensitivity in the sleep stages W and R. Equally the RNN has learned the transition between the sleep stages W and N1.

Further improvements in this projects can be achieved by merging sleep stages N3 and N4. 
%The affect of stacking multiple LSTM cells and apply the LSTM cell from layers with a lower-level feature representation and a higher spatial variance.
